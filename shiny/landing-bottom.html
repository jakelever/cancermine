	This knowledge base is automatically extracted using text mining tools. We use a supervised learning approach where a set of experts have annotated a large set of sentences to be used as examples for a machine learning system. This machine learning system is <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/kindred">Kindred</a>, a Python package for relation extraction. It is the successor to our <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/VERSE">VERSE system</a> that won part of the <a href="http://2016.bionlp-st.org">BioNLP'16 Shared Task</a> for relation extraction. This machine learning system is then applied to all abstracts in PubMed and all full text papers in the Pubmed Central Open Access subset.
