In the most recent decades, a few endeavors have been made to create systems that could viably induce potent immune responses against different tumor types. Application of the immune system against disease cells is viewed as one of the advantageous strategies since the immune system can control different sorts of tumors  . In this manner, active immunization is a promising technique to activate the immune system to attack cancerous cells that has low poisonous quality and wonderful specificity. Cancer immunizations change the way introductory patient reacts and reactions to consequent treatments post-vaccination is assessed  . Using monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are two immunotherapeutic methodologies for the treatment of bosom disease  . Mucin (MUC1) and HER2/neu (HER2) are two tumor marker candidates for diagnosis and vaccination of breast cancer. Subsequently, vaccines give new insight into immunization to produce a powerful response to HER2 or MUC1 expressing carcinomas  . Human mucin (MUC1), as a transmembrane glycoprotein, has an extracellular domain consisting of a tandem repeat 20 amino acid polypeptide sequence with various O-glycosylation residues  . The number of these repeats is different based on population genetics. The broad glycosylation of MUC1 present in ordinary tissues may further interfere with immune system reaction. It has been proposed that the peptides of MUC1s are not completely glycosylated in cancer cells, bringing about the presentation to the insusceptible arrangement of peptide groupings that are not normally exposed  . The MUC1 protein is unusually expressed on an expected 75% of all human solid tumor diseases  . There is preclinical information in rodents exhibiting that MUC1 based immunizations are immunogenic in both humoral and cell styles. For example, inhibition of tumor growth has been associated with antibody production and T cell activation  . HER2 is another source of TAAs that has been broadly examined in breast malignancy. HER2/ neu  is an individual from the epidermal development component receptor group of trans-membrane tyrosine kinases developing tumor progression and is found in about 75–80% of breast carcinoma  . This overexpression can bring about a 100–200-fold HER2 protein in tumor versus typical tissue and is a set up for immunizer and vaccination  . These findings have suggested that immunization against HER2 and MUC1 may be possible and that this immunization might prevent tumor regrowth in patients with breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">introduction</infon><offset>3980</offset><text>For these reasons, we have tested this approach against two targets that are commonly co-expressed in breast cancer, namely MUC1 and HER2  .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">introduction</infon><offset>4120</offset><text>Our aim in this study was to employ the recombinant HER2-MUC1 (rHM) as a chimeric protein vaccination in a mouse model to develop a more efficacious vaccine against breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">materials and methods</infon><offset>4299</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">materials and methods</infon><offset>4320</offset><text>Construct design, culture condition and preparation of HM protein vaccine</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">materials and methods</infon><offset>4393</offset><text>Using in silico  analyses, the antigenic sequence of the human HER2 extracellular domain (480-620 aa) and MUC1 (220-360 aa) were selected and linked together by a hydrophilic linker (5 repetitive sequences of EAAAK).

Two and four weeks after injection, the animals were boosted with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant.

Initiation of the patients’ own immune system is one of a few promising vaccination techni-ques for controlling cancer development. On the other hand, cancerous cells are generally resistant to the anti-tumor activities including apoptosis, necrosis, and so on. Since tumor cells regularly do not display their own antigens to T cells, one of the significant objectives of tumor immunotherapy is producing tumor particular T cells  . Immunotherapy against cancer is one of the new fields of research and creates active response against the tumor surface antigens. Cancer vaccine based on surface antigens can be a new way to treat tumors. The main goal of the vaccine is inducing specific response against the tumors, then it is considered nontoxic and can eventually give long immunity against the tumor, which prevents the tumor from returning  .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>16757</offset><text>Human MUC1 is one of the few well-characterized tumor neoantigens. Polarized expression of MUC1 in a few epithelial tumors is lost and the ordinarily vigorously glycosylated protein is overexpressed in hypo and non-glycosylated forms. This irregular glycosylation leads to the expression of novel B and T cell epitopes inside the tandemly repeating sequence of 20 amino acids. Low recurrence CTL and low titer IgM responses against MUC1 are available in cancer patients, however, they don’t counteract malignancy development. In this way, boosting MUC1 specific immunity with immunizations could efficiently trigger cancer immunotherapy  . One of the key proto-oncogenes in breast cancer is HER2 (known as ErbB2). A few cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) peptide epitopes of HER2 have been characterized and their capacity to affect HER2 peptide particular CTLs could be shown in clinical trials  . Without a doubt, HER2 is essential in proliferation and viability of tumor and numerous parts of tumor development are positively influenced through its activation. HER2 receptors and signaling from them and associated molecules lead to increased cell motility, decreased apoptosis, enhancing signaling interactions with the microenvironment, regulating adhesion, as well as a multitude of other functions  . These findings suggest that HER2 may offer significant promise as a potential target for antigen-specific immunotherapy of HER2 positive human cancers. In addition to TAAs, HER2 and MUC1 also can stimulate an expansive number of T cells, triggering cytokine secretion from T cells and monocytes; therefore, the antitumor activity of the immune system is promoted to inhibit tumor development and metastasis  . Inducing a strong anti-tumor T cell response is one of the vital procedures to obtain an appropriate immunotherapy  . Evidence is emerging that a successful cancer vaccine should be multimodal and activate several aspects of the immune system at once. Although cellular and humoral immune responses against MUC1 and HER2 have been observed in some cancer patients, it has been difficult to design cancer vaccine candidates that can elicit both of these responses  . In this study, we demonstrated the immunization activity of a recombinant chimeric HM protein vaccine expressing epitopes of MUC1 and HER2 in E. coli BL21(DE3) , fused together using a linker by which the domains efficiently lead to their appropriate folding on both tumor growth and metas-tases formation. Having evaluated the sequences of HER2 and MUC1 genes in both human and mouse, we found no considerable difference between related sequences in these organisms. Therefore, mice can be applied as a suitable immunological model to eluci-date the immunotherapeutic capability of our human-based HER2-MUC1 vaccine. Because of this, we employed a mouse model for mammary cancer to demonstrate that the bilateral vaccine can elicit IgG antibodies which can lyse MUC1 or HER2 expressing cancer cells, stimulate cytotoxicity of T lymphocytes, and activate innate immune responses, thereby reversing resistance and creating a remedial response. Because the pathways of murine T cell activation are similar to those of human T cells, experimental results in mice can be also generalized to humans  . HM in our study stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes and produced cytotoxic cytokines (mainly INFγ) indicating its particular role in tumor cell lysis and necrosis. Although it is not well-known how necrosis is induced, it is assumed that the injuries are triggered by the induced CTLs as well as the produced cytokines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>20364</offset><text>We used the MTT assay in order to evaluate the proliferation or suppressive effects of above the mentioned recombinant protein. A greater proliferation of the cells obviously leads to the formation of more crystals and an increase in the SI. It has been clarified in this study that HM can cause stimulation and proliferation of mouse splenocytes better than the splenocytes without proximity with HM  . According to the results obtained from Bioinformatics tools, measuring the tumor size  , measuring the cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-4   and measuring the magnitude of tumor necrosis  , it was shown that tumor growth in the mice test group compared with the mice control group displayed significant reduction ( P &lt; 0.05; ). Measurement of IFNγ, IL-17, and IL-4 in this group showed that the amount of the produced IFNγ and IL-17 compared with the produced IL-4, in the mice control group was significantly different ( P &lt;0.05; ). In this study, we showed that the recombinant HM evoked a Th1 response toward the inserted epitopes, as evidenced by IFNγ secretion by splenocytes isolated in response to HER2 and MUC1 stimuli, whereas the Th2 response appeared weak. Therefore, the increase of IFNγ and IL-17 compared with IL-4 indicates that the HM protein enhances the antitumor activity. Our results showed that the magnitude of tumor necrosis in the mice test group compared with the mice control group was significantly different ( P &lt;0.05), and the magnitude of tumor necrosis caused by administering HM in comparison with the mice control group, just Freund’s adjuvant, or PBS was higher; this finding goes together with the results indicating reduction of tumor size. Our evaluation of HM vaccination may open a new approach for clinical management of patients with breast cancer. This in vivo  investigation indicates that HM could be useful, but further investigations including detailed studies searching for side effects are warranted. Another dataset demonstrates that dual targeting can lead to the delivery of complementary signals that enhance splenocytes proliferation  .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">discussion</infon><offset>22452</offset><text>However, other evidence showed that polyvalent vaccines, including protein vaccines and DNA vaccines, can engender more effective protection than univalent vaccines in some cases  .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">conclusion</infon><offset>22633</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section">article</infon><infon key="subsection">conclusion</infon><offset>22643</offset><text>The designed construct has the significant potential to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses effectively, and the results showed that the antigenicity of MUC1 and HER2 differs between malignant and normal tissue, and therefore, a HER2-MUC1 based cancer vaccine, if effective, could hold a great promise and would be highly valuable in medical oncology.
